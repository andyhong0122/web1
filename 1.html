<p> I am here working my on case study as we close into finalizing another season here at 
Glass Lewis. Glass Lewis, supposedly one of the world's largest corporate governance 
consultancy, providing a multitiude of services across the world. You can say we're on some
very important stuff right here. Secrets.</p> 
<p>Well, if I finish this case study I would have nothing else to do so here I am
killing time with my buddies playing tetris and all that fun stuff. After all, what's life without
 a little fooling around when there's air to breathe and laughs to share. </p>
